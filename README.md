dotfiles
========

My bash setup
The Makefile will install the dot files to your home directory if you run `make install`. 
You can also update this folder by running `make update`
Running `make export` will add, commit and push all changes to your repo with a standard commit message,
so if you want a sensible commit message do it manualy instead.
